Examples
========

There are several example files which can be opened using the `IPython notebook <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_,
an interactive web-based frontend to python which you will have installed if you
followed the :doc:`Installation Instructions <install>`.

Web Preview
-----------

You can view *non-interactive* output without installing anything
`here <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DavidPowell/openmodes-examples/tree/master/>`_.
From this link, click on any of the examples (``*.ipynb``) and they will open as a web page.

Running Examples
----------------

To run the examples yourself

1. Ensure that you have successfully installed OpenModes as per the
   :doc:`Installation Instructions <install>`.
2. Download the `zip file <https://github.com/DavidPowell/openmodes-examples/archive/master.zip>`_
   with all the examples and unzip them into a folder.
3. Open the IPython notebook. If you have installed python using the `Anaconda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_
   distribution (the recommended way, especially on Windows), then the notebook should be available from the
   Launcher. Otherwise, open a command prompt and run ``ipython notebook``
4. From the notebook file browser, navigate to the folder containing the examples and open one of the example notebooks
5. To re-run the whole example from the menu bar by select ``Cell->Run All``. You should try modifying the examples
   with different parameters, and you only need to run cells again if you have changed something.
