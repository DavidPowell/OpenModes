Installation Instructions
=========================

OpenModes is written in the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ language, and
utilises the program gmsh to mesh the structure geometries.

Windows Quick Install
---------------------

The simplest way to get started is to download `Python(x,y) 
<https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_, which includes all the required python 
libraries. 

Then install `gmsh <http://geuz.org/gmsh/>`_, and make sure that the gmsh
executable is added to the windows PATH environment variable.

Download the OpenModes executable package from ??? and install it.

Requirements
------------
The following software packages are the absolute minimum to run OpenModes:

- python 2.7 (3.x not currently supported)
- numpy (1.6.2 or later)
- gmsh
- matplotlib (to plot the results)

Strongly recommended packages

- IPython (the notebook is used by many of the examples)

Other packages which may be useful

- spyder (a GUI for editing python)
- scipy (contains many useful computational python routines)
- ViSit or ParaView (3D plotting software)

OpenModes contains some core routines which are optimised using fortran.
Therefore, on platforms where a binary package of OpenModes is not provided,
a fortran compiler is required.


For windows users, there are several choices of scientific python distribution
which may also be suitable

- WinPython (known to work)
- Anaconda
- Enthought Python Distribution

Due to the lack of good free fortran compilers for windows, you will need to
install a 32 bit version of any of these distributions

Ubuntu Linux
------------

For ubuntu users, the appropriate packages can be installed using the following
command

``sudo apt-get install python python-numpy python-matplotlib gmsh gfortran
ipython python-dev``

Mac OSX
-------

This code has not been tested for Mac OSX, but there is no known reason why it should
not work. All required packages are available from the MacPorts project.
