OpenModes
=========

A Method of Moments (Boundary Element Method) code designed to find the modes
of open resonators such as meta-atoms, (nano) antennas, scattering particles
etc.

Using these modes, broadband models of these elements can be created, enabling
excitation, coupling between them and scattering to be solved easily, and
broadband models to be created

Requires the python packages numpy, scipy and matplotlib, and the free meshing
program gmsh. See doc/install.txt for full instructions and requirements.
